# a-claymorphism-demo

A lightweight prototype that showcases the core traits of the claymorphism design trend:

- Pastel gradients that make surfaces feel soft and sculpted
- Long, diffused shadows that create a hovering effect
- Inner highlights and subtle noise for tactile realism

## Styleguide
- **Typography:** Use the "Poppins" family with medium weight for headlines and regular weight for supporting copy to maintain the rounded, friendly look.
- **Color Palette:** Stick to the existing soft gradient backgrounds (#f7d9ff → #c1e5ff) and neutral foreground colors to preserve the claymorphism depth effect.
- **Depth Effects:** Pair outer drop-shadows (12px 12px 24px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.25)) with soft inner highlights to simulate molded surfaces, and avoid harsh or high-contrast shadows.
